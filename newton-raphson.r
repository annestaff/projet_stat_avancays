### NEWTON RAPHSON ALGORITHM ###
# Goal: find the root (x axis intersection) of a function, works for real and complex functions
# 1. pick a random point x of the function ("first guess")
# 2. find the tangent to the curve at that point x
# 3. find the intersection of the tangent with the x axis and make it your new x
# 4. repeat until you're close enough (delta-y below a certain threshold which defines that you're on a point)
